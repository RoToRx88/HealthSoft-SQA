## HealthSoft - SQA

Welcome one the SQA website of HealthSoft. The goal of the SQA office is to improve practices in order to get better software quality.

> _Abstract:_ For the redaction of this document, I was largely inspired by my experience at Sogilis, a French company developing high quality software, where I worked the last year. We use at Sogilis agile for everything, not only as a process of software development, but also as a methodology for the management of the whole company.

## Who am I?

My name is Nicolas COMTE, my student number is D16124638, and my email is d16124638 [at] mydit.ie
I oversee the Software Quality Assurance office.

## Why a SQA office?

During many years HealthSoft worked very well without any SQA Office. But as the company grow, and our customers are being more exigent we must adapt our process and our way of developing software.
That's what the SQA Office if intended for. During the following weeks, we will discuss together and review our actual practices and identify an aspect that needs improvement.
Then we'll plan the actions to take and act in consequences.
Finally, we'll evaluate the results and the benefits of the actions taken, and plan again other actions if needed.

## State of art

The actual process of project management is following a waterfall cycle.
The major disadvantage of this project cycle is that we cannot assure a effective monitoring with the customer.
It adds a lot of latency and misunderstanding from both sides (customer and developer).
Also, there is not much feedback from the development team about the problems they encounter and sometimes it can lead to a huge delay in the delivery.

## Agile method, Scrum master: a new solution

### Agile

To manage a project such as a software development there is different ways to do. Here at HealthSoft since a long time we use a traditional waterfall method. You all use it every day on every project and it works.
Recently, in the 1990 a new method was introduced. This method is called __Agile method.__ This method is particularly adapted to the software development environment and is today widely used in many companies.
Agile method is ruled by a manifesto, which is accessible at the following address: [agilemanifesto.org](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

Here are the 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto (_source: [agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/principles.html)_)

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

* Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

* Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

* Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

* Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

* The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

* Working software is the primary measure of progress.

* Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

* Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

* Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

* The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

### Scrum master

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. Are there any impediments in your way?

> The authors described a new approach to commercial product-development that would increase speed and flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer industries. They called this the holistic or rugby approach, as the whole process is performed by one cross-functional team across multiple overlapping phases, where the team "tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth". (In rugby football, a scrum refers to a tight-packed formation of players with their heads down who attempt to gain possession of the ball.)

Srum is an agile framework that introduce a set of process in accordance with the Agile manifest. In this framework, the team self-organize and can make change quickly. The three pillars of Scrum are __transparency, inspection,__ and __adaptation__. The team need to inspect the product being developed frequently so they can spot any problem or deviance as soon as possible. Each member of the team must trust and be open. Here are the 5 values a team member should match:
* Commitment: You individually commit to achieve your team goals.
* Courage: You know you have the courage to work through conflict and challenges as a team, and do the right thing.
* Focus: You focus your work on what is in your backlog, and your work is only done through the backlog.
* Openness: You must be totally transparent about what you do, and more importantly about the challenge you encounter. There is no judgment here, you are part of a team and you work with the help of the team to resolve the challenge you face.
* Respect: You respect each member of the team as technically capable of doing the work, and when they face a problem, you work with them as a team to solve it.

In Scrum master, there is three different roles.
The __Product Owner__ is the person representing the customer’s stakeholders. There is only one PO for each project.  His role is to write customer-centric items sur as user stories. User stories are an informal way to explain a core feature of a software system, written in natural language. The Product Owner role must not be combined with the Scrum Master role. The Product Owner focus on the business side of the product and should not dictate how the team reaches a technical solution.

The __Scrum Master__ is a facilitator, and there is only one Scrum Master per team. The SM is __NOT__  a team leader of project manager. His role is to act as a buffer between the development team and any distracting influences. The Scrum Master also help the team for example to work on the Definition of Done for the product. The Definition of Done is all the criteria required to define a task as done. He also helps the team to work together by acting as a facilitator. A huge responsibility of the Scrum Master is also to educate the PO in Scrum principles and agile methodology.  *__Although the title of scrum master sounds powerful, the scrum master is not the project leader and is not held accountable for outcomes. The team as a whole is responsible for outcomes.__*

The __Development Team__ is responsible for delivering the product at the end of each sprint. A Development Team should not excess 10 persons. A DT is self-organized and is cross-functional

## Why Agile & scrum master? / The Benefits

* improve communication with DSU
* Retrospective allow to success again
    * aka process improvement
* maybe talk about blackbox effect, the direction plus the client needs more transparency
* Agile manifest
    * "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it"
* Big point on customer collaboration
* Responding to change instead of a plan
* __SEE THE PAGE 1 OF PPT BOTTOM RIGHT__
* scrum take in consideration the customer can change his mind to another idea

----------------------
----------------------

## How are we going to implement it?

* break the actual organization and you'll create a new team for each project incoming.
    * you can of course keep the in place system of teams, it is entirely up to you
* teams
* sprint
    * you decide of the size
* backlog
* DSU
* Retro
* Retro customer
* ADAPT THE INVOICE AND EXPLAIN HOW IT’S GONNA WORK


----------------------
----------------------

## Measurement

* we don't want to monitor you or your work, we trust you, but still have metrics you agree with so if failure we can understand why and __improve next time__
    * working software is the primary metric
* Definition of done
