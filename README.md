## HealthSoft - SQA

Welcome one the SQA website of HealthSoft. The goal of the SQA office is to improve practices in order to get better software quality.

## Who am I ?

My name is Nicolas COMTE, my student number is D16124638, and my email is d16124638 [at] mydit.ie
I'll be in charge of the Software Quality Assurance office.

## Why a SQA office ?

During many years HealthSoft worked very well without any SQA Office. But as the company growth, and our customers are being more exigents we have to adapt our processes and way of doing software.
That's what the SQA Office if intended for. During the following weeks we will disscuss together and review our actual practices and identify an aspect that needs improvement.
Then we'll plan the actions to take and act in consequences.
Finally we'll evalute the results and the benefits of the actions taken, and replan other actions if needed.
